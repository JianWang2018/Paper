Andrej Karpathy, Li Fei Fei |2015   |We present a model that generates natural language de-
scriptions of images and their regions. Our approach lever-
ages datasets of images and their sentence descriptions to
learn about the inter-modal correspondences between lan-
guage and visual data. Our alignment model is based on a
novel combination of Convolutional Neural Networks over
image regions, bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks
over sentences, and a structured objective that aligns the
two modalities through a multimodal embedding. We then
describe a Multimodal Recurrent Neural Network architec-
ture that uses the inferred alignments to learn to generate
novel descriptions of image regions. We demonstrate that
our alignment model produces state of the art results in re-
trieval experiments on Flickr8K, Flickr30K and MSCOCO
datasets. We then show that the generated descriptions sig-
nificantly outperform retrieval baselines on both full images
and on a new dataset of region-level annotations.
